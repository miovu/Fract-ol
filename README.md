The term fractal was first used by mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot in 1974. He based
it on the Latin word fractus which means "broken" or "fractured".
A fractal is an abstract mathematical object, such as a curve or a surface, whose
pattern remains consistent at every scale.

This project is a program I created to generate fractals.
